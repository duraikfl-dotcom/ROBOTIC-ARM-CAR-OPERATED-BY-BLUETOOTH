Bluetooth Controlled Robotic Arm Car - Arduino UNO Project

This project demonstrates a fully functional robotic vehicle integrated with a 3-axis arm, controlled wirelessly via a Bluetooth module and an Android application.

The primary objective of this vehicle is to perform basic industrial tasks, such as controlled movement and precision object manipulation (pick-up and placement).

My Key Contribution: Mechatronics Design and Integration (The 20% Focus)

While utilizing AI assistance for initial code structuring and knowledge gathering (80%), my core expertise and focus were dedicated to the essential practical engineering challenges.

This is where my skills lie:

• Mechanical Design: Designed and fabricated the custom chassis and the 3-axis robotic arm structure for stability and functionality.

•Hardware Integration & Assembly: Successfully wired and interfaced the Arduino UNO with all peripheral components (Motors, Servos, Bluetooth Module, and Power Supply).

• System Integration: Ensured seamless communication protocol and functional synchronization between the wireless control (Bluetooth) and the physical components.

This project showcases a strong aptitude for transforming software concepts into working hardware prototypes.
